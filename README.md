# 🐾 CatCare

**CatCare** is my very first iOS app — a humble beginning into the world of mobile development.  
It's a work-in-progress "Pet Care Tracker" designed to help cat owners keep track of their cat’s daily needs.

⚠️ _This project is not fully complete and is no longer under active development._  
I built it as a way to learn SwiftUI, @AppStorage, navigation, and building UI layouts — and I'm proud of how far it came.

## ✨ What It Does (So Far)

- Choose your cat avatar and name it 🐱  
- Track essential care tasks with playful pawprint buttons:
  - Feeding (twice per day)
  - Watering
  - Litterbox cleaning
- Create a care schedule for:
  - Feeding times and frequency
  - Watering and litterbox
  - Vaccination or vet appointments
- View a weekly planner with scheduled reminders
- All local storage – no accounts or external services

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- `SwiftUI` for building the interface  
- `@AppStorage` to persist cat name and preferences  
- `UserDefaults` to save tasks  
- Custom navigation stack and SwiftUI components
